# Bingo Generator

Hey there! You need to generate Bingo grids for some occasion? You're at the right place!

## Overview

### Functional overview

This project is a website that generates Bingo grids. Tile disposition is random and grid dimensions can be specified. Grid data are embedded in shareable URLs so that there is no need for servers.

### Technical overview

This is my first project with React and its ecosystem. Here are some librairies I discovered:

- [React](https://reactjs.org 'React')
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com 'React Router')
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io 'Jest')
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com 'styled-components')

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org 'TypeScript') is heavily used as well.
